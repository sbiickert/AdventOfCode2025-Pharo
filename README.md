# AdventOfCode2025-Pharo

Smalltalk code in preparation for the Advent of Code 2025 event.

## Why isn't this in the AdventOfCode2025 Repo?

This code is being written, tested and run in a [Pharo](https://pharo.org) image, as is usual for Smalltalk. Pharo has GitHub integration, but it's a little more rudimentary than normal.
It puts the code into a structure that I didn't have much control over, so rather than make a mess of my main AoC 2025 repo, I created another one dedicated to this.
